    <h1>Red Notice:</h1>
    <p>Two thousand years ago, Roman general Mark Antony gifts Egyptian queen Cleopatra three bejeweled eggs as a wedding gift to show his devotion. The eggs are lost in time until two are found by a farmer in 1907, but the last one remains lost.</p>
    <p>In 2021, John Hartley, who is the criminal profiler for the FBI is assigned to assist Interpol agent Urvashi Das in investigating the potential theft of one of the eggs on display at the Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome. The head of security dismisses the concerns, but Hartley reveals the egg is a forgery and the real egg has been stolen. Before the room is sealed shut, international art thief Nolan Booth manages to escape with the egg. Arriving at his home in Bali with the egg, he finds Hartley, along with Das and an Interpol strike team there. They arrest Booth and take the egg into custody. Unbeknownst to everyone, Booth's main competition, Sarah "The Bishop" Black, disguised as one of the strike team members, swaps the real egg with another forgery. The next day, Das confronts Hartley and has him incarcerated in a remote Russian prison in the same cell as Booth, believing he's responsible for the theft.</p>
 
    <p>Shortly after arrival, Black proposes that Booth work with her to find the third egg as he knows about its whereabouts. Booth declines her modest offer, so Hartley suggests they work together to beat her. If Booth helps him imprison her, Booth will be the number one art thief in the world. The pair escapes from prison, heading to Valencia to steal the second egg, in possession of notorious arms dealer Sotto Voce who is having a masquerade ball. There, they find Black, who is also there to steal it. The three arrive in Voce's vault where Hartley and Booth fight Black. Voce arrives with his security detail while Black reveals she is working with Voce. They torture Hartley until Booth reveals the location of the third egg. Black double-crosses Voce and leaves for Egypt where Booth claims it is. After leaving Valencia, Booth reveals to Hartley that the egg is actually in Argentina, a location only he knows as it was inscribed on his late father's beloved watch which had once belonged to Adolf Hitler's personal art curator Rudolph Zeich.</p>

    <p>They search the Argentinian jungle, to find a secret bunker, full of countless Nazi artifacts, including the third egg. Black steals the egg from them, only to be interrupted by Das and a team of local police. Hartley, Booth and Black escape in an antique 1931 Mercedes-Benz 770, chased by Das in an armored vehicle. Eventually, they exit near the top of a waterfall where they jump. Booth swims to shore with the egg, only to discover that Hartley and Black are actually professional partners and Hartley was never an FBI but a conman like his father, both going by the pseudonym Bishop. Booth surrenders the egg and they leave him handcuffed. In Cairo, Hartley and Black deliver the three eggs to an Egyptian billionaire, in time for his daughter's wedding. The wedding is subsequently interrupted by Das' Interpol raid who arrest the bride and her father.</p>

        <p>6 months later in Sardinia, Hartley and Black are met again by Booth who informs them that he told Das about their Cayman Islands account containing the $300 million payout, which Das freezes leaving them with no money. Booth also reveals that Interpol is on their way to capture them, but offers a chance to escape if they help him with a new heist, which requires three individuals to pull off. They agree and escape, and Das places red notices on all three of them as they begin their heist at the Louvre.</p>
